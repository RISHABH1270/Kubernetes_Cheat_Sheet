# Dive into Kubernetes with Minikube: Your Ultimate Hands-On Cheatsheet!

This is a concise, beginner-oriented reference guide containing essential Kubernetes commands I‚Äôm using while practicing locally with Minikube. I will continue to expand it with additional commands and detailed explanations ‚Äî updates coming soon! üöÄ

Kubernetes takes care of all the concerns like container networking, resource management, security, high availability, fault tolerance, service discovery, scalability, load balancing, and orchestration‚Äîproviding an enterprise-level solution for managing containerized applications at scale.

In Kubernetes, the cluster architecture is divided into two main parts:

### üß† Master Node (Control Plane)
The master node manages the cluster‚Äîit makes global decisions, like scheduling and scaling.

Key Components:      
kube-apiserver - The front-end of the control plane; receives all REST requests from users, CLI, or controllers.     
etcd - A key-value store for all cluster data; acts as the source of truth.     
kube-scheduler - Watches for unscheduled pods and assigns them to suitable worker nodes based on resources, policies, etc.     
kube-controller-manager - Runs controllers (like node, replication, endpoints) that ensure the cluster‚Äôs desired state is maintained.    
cloud-controller-manager - Handles cloud-specific logic (e.g., provisioning load balancers, managing storage in AWS, GCP, etc.).     

### ‚öôÔ∏è Worker Node
The worker node actually runs the containerized applications.

Key Components:      
kubelet - Agent that runs on each worker node; ensures containers are running as expected by talking to the control plane.      
kube-proxy - Manages networking rules (NAT, IP forwarding) to allow communication between pods and services.         
Container Runtime - Software that actually runs the containers, such as containerd, Docker, or CRI-O.     
Pods - The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, running your actual containers.     

## üöÄ Start Minikube      

Minikube is a local Kubernetes environment designed to simplify learning and development. It allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine using Docker or a compatible container runtime.
        
To install the latest minikube stable release on x86-64 macOS using Homebrew:       
```bash
brew install minikube
```

For more details, refer to the https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download

Starts a single-node Minikube cluster locally.
```bash
minikube start
```

Starts a multi-node Minikube cluster (3 nodes) with a custom profile name multinode-cluster.
```bash
minikube start --nodes 3 -p multinode-cluster
```

Access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the minikube cluster:
```bash
minikube dashboard
```

Before going further, make sure you have installed kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
If not, install it from the official documentation here:      
üëâ Install kubectl - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Contexts (Clusters)

Lists all available contexts and manage access to multiple clusters and highlights the current one with a *.
```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

Switches your active Kubernetes context to the minikube.
```bash
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

Stop your local cluster:
```bash
minikube stop
```

Delete your local cluster:
```bash
minikube delete
```

Delete all local clusters and profiles
```bash
minikube delete --all
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Get all the Nodes in the cluster

Displays all nodes in the cluster and their status.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

## üì¶ Get Namespaces

Get a list of namespaces in the cluster:
```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

## üìã Get Resources in a Kubernetes cluster

Get all resources in the default namespace:
```bash
kubectl get all
```

Get all resources in a specific namespace (e.g., kube-system):
```bash
kubectl get all -n kube-system
```

Get all resources in all namespaces:
```bash
kubectl get all -A
```

## üìö To see the API documentation

```bash
kubectl explain pod
kubectl explain pod.spec
kubectl explain pod.metadata
kubectl explain pod.status
```

## üß© Create a Pod on a Worker Node (Imperative and Declarative)

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can consists one or more containers.       

Imperative Way (One-liner Command)
```bash
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx:latest
```

Create pod on a specific node:
```yaml
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --overrides='
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "spec": {
    "nodeSelector": {
      "kubernetes.io/hostname": "multinode-cluster-m02"
    }
  }
}' --restart=Never
```

üìÑ Declarative Way Using YAML - Create a file pod.yaml
```bash
vim pod.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: multinode-cluster-m02
```
```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

## üîç Describe a Pod

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Now to check on whick worker node the pod is running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
Getting every information about a specific pods:
```bash
kubectl describe pod my-pod
```
Getting labels associated with a pod:
```bash
kubectl get pods my-pod --show-labels
```

## üóëÔ∏è Delete a Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod my-pod
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging a Pod

If the image within the container inside the pod has been altered or tampered:
```yaml
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx123
```
In this case, the pod won't be ready, and its status will show "ImagePullBackOff" or "ErrImage"
```bash
kubectl describe pod my-pod
```
You'll find the latest error message in the Events section. 
           
Potential reasons:        
Registry unavailable         
Repository unavailable        
Image unavailable       
Authorization required       
Authorization failed      

To directly edit the configuration of an existing Resources in the cluster: 
```bash
kubectl edit pod my-pod
```

## üîê‚û°Ô∏è Get inside a Pod

Accessing a Pod's shell is similar to how you exec into a Docker container.     

```bash
kubectl exec -it my-pod -- sh
```

For multiple containers running inside a pod:
```bash
kubectl exec -it my-pod -c nginx -- bash
```

```bash
pwd
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic creation of YAML

Kubernetes supports both YAML and JSON for defining configuration files for Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.       
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client
```

Redirects the command output and saves it into a new file - 
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod-new.yaml
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o json > pod-new.json
```

It will create a yaml file and later you can make change in this as per your requirement:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

## üì¶üì¶üì¶ Kubernetes ReplicaSet 

ReplicationController are legacy one and ReplicaSet are new by this you can target and manage the existing pods with labels and selectors. The ReplicaController or ReplicaSet ensures that the desired number of Pods are always running at any given time. It continuously monitors the health of each Pod and handles incoming requests by using load balancing logic to route them to healthy Pods ensures high availability.         

Manages multiple replicas of an NGINX pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of pod replicas
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:  # Pod template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml
```
Get all the ReplicaSet:
```bash
kubectl get rs
```
Scale the ReplicaSet using Imperative way:
```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=5 nginx-replicaset
```

## üì¶üì¶üì¶üõ†Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment:

Pods --> ReplicationController --> ReplicaSet --> Deployment       
         
Supports:      
Rolling updates (e.g., nginx:1.1 ‚Üí nginx:1.2)    
Zero downtime       
Rollback if update fails      
Automates safe transitions between versions.      
ReplicaSet = raw pod management      
Deployment = smart version-controlled lifecycle manager       
              
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest  # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Just change version here
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
One new pod with 1.2 is created (maxSurge: 1)           
One old pod with 1.1 is removed (maxUnavailable: 1)

```bash
kubectl apply -f dp.yaml
```

## üìú Check Rollout History

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

## üîÅ Rollback a Deployment

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

## üåç Service in Kubernetes

Services exposes your app to outer world and it provides you a consistent endpoint (IP + DNS name).      
A Service selects pods using labels and then forwards traffic to them.      
          
There are 4 types of Services:     

- NodePort (Access the application through the port exposed by the node and then internal routing to targeted port happens)
  
#### Sample YAML for Nodeport
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      nodePort: 30080     # External port exposed on each node (30000-32767)
      port: 80            # Port exposed by the service inside the cluster
      targetPort: 80      # Port on the pod/container  
```

- ClusterIP(For Internal access)
- LoadBalancer(To access the application on a domain name or IP address without using the port number)
- External (To use an external DNS for routing)
